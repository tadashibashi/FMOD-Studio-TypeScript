IFMOD.ts is an namespace of interfaces and structures written in TypeScript, which corresponds to the fmodstudio.js library (currently working out of studio version 1.10.10). This adds type safety and covenient JSDOC documentation to the FMOD Studio HTML5 experience.

To use the interface, create a new TypeScript (.ts) file and import the IFMOD namespace into the file with -

import { IFMOD } from 'path/to/IFMOD.ts';

Most references to the FMOD namespace can be 'typed' to interfaces from the IFMOD namespace. IFMOD is still under construction, so much of the library is currently underway.
